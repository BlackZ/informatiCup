Building an apk
===============================================================================

For building an apk, buildozer is used. Buildozer needs python-for-android. For
more information see http://buildozer.readthedocs.org/en/latest/.

The needed files are found in this directory:
- buildozer.spec
- main.py
- recipe.sh
- setup.py

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
buildozer.spec
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the file uses to configurate buildozer. For packaging it should be in
the main directory where buildozer is called.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
main.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the entry point for android. It replaces run_isySUR.py (entry point for
running on computer) in the main directory.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
recipe.sh
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To include Python packages into an apk they must be known to
python-for-android. To use own packages like isySUR python-for-android has to
learn them. For this a recipe file is necessary. The recipe.sh and the sources
have to been put into the recipes directory of python-for-android.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
setup.py
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This file is also needed in the recipes directory of python-for-android to tell
the system how to build the package.

===============================================================================

When putting every file in the right place, an apk is build with
$ buildozer android debug
or
$buildozer android release
and can be installed to any android device with android 2.2 or higher.
