What should be talked about:

 * Tickets (What do we really want to achieve, create and assign subtasks)
 * Regular meetings/hacking days?
 * Development environment (language [Python?], unittests?, special frameworks, e.g. pybuilder)
 * Important code conventions (e.g. code language, best practises)
 * Our goal in the "competition"
 
 
What has been talked about:

 * Goal: Command line program to read in input and compute polygons
 
 * Competitiongoal: Acceptable results (better then 50% coverage)
 * Weekly meetings (Thursday 12-14) including hacking session
 * Programming language: Python(2.7)
 * unittesting (test first, implement later)
 * No complete framework, but check coverage
 * Create module
 * Code language=English (incl Comments)
 * Pythondocs for main functions
 * Not too long lines
 * Static constants all Upper case
